Abstract
Global climate change is causing increasing variability and extremes in weather worldwide, a trend set to continue. 
In recent decades both anomalously warm and cold seawater temperatures have resulted in mass coral bleaching events. 
Whilst corals' response to elevated temperature has justifiably attracted substantial research interest, coral 
physiology under cold water stress is relatively unfamiliar. The response to below winter ambient water temperature 
was tested for two common reef building species from the Gulf of Aqaba in an ex situ experiment. Stylophora pistillata 
and Acropora eurystoma were exposed to 2 or 4°C below ambient and a suite of physiological parameters were assessed. 
At 4°C below ambient (ca. 18.6°C), both species had significant declines in photosynthetic indices (maximum quantum yield, 
electron transport rate, saturation irradiance, and photochemical efficiency) and chlorophyll concentration compared 
to corals at ambient winter temperatures. It was previously unknown that corals at this site live close to their 
cold-water bleaching threshold and may be vulnerable as climate variability increases in magnitude. In order to determine
if the cold winter reduces the known heat resistance of this population, the corals were subsequently exposed to a heat 
stress of 3°C above typical summer temperatures. Exposed to heat stress, both species showed fewer physiological deviations
compared to the cold-water stress. The cold winter experience did not increase corals' susceptibility to heat stress. 
This study provides further support for the selection of heat tolerant genotypes colonising the Red Sea basin and thereby 
also supporting the mechanism behind the Reef Refuge Hypothesis.
